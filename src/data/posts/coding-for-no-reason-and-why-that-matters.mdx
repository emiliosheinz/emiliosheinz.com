title: Coding for no reason and why that matters
description: Side projects don’t have to become products. Sometimes their only job is to make you excited to open your editor again. That’s when the best ideas and learning happen.

Every once in a while, I like to code for no reason at all.

No roadmaps. No tickets. No best practices.

Just opening Neovim and building something because it feels interesting.

Early in my career, that was basically all I did. I didn’t care about best practices, clean code, SOLID, DRY, KISS, or whatever acronym was trending at the time. Actually, I didn't even know about them. I just coded. I had an idea, wrote some code, ran it, saw what happened, and repeated until it worked (or until I got bored).

Somewhere along the way, coding became mostly about outcomes, business value, deadlines, and metrics.

Don’t get me wrong, they are all important.

But from time to time, I really miss that feeling of pure curiosity.

So I try to recreate it on purpose.

I start a random project with zero expectations. No plan to monetize it. No intention to polish it. Most of the time, it ends up in my infinite pile of half-finished GitHub repos, and I forget about it a week later.

This time was different!!!

I started playing around with an idea, threw some code together, followed my curiosity, and ended up with a fully functional Rubik’s Cube running in the browser, which I embedded into my own website.

Was it useful? I don't think so.
Was it perfect? Absolutely not.
Was it fun? A LOT.

Building it gave me an excuse to finally play with React Three Fiber, and it brought back some very specific memories from university: OpenGL classes and the frustration of not understanding why my screen was pitch black and nothing was being rendered.

These “useless” coding sessions remind me why I started doing this in the first place. Not to chase best practices or perfect abstractions, but because turning ideas into something that moves on the screen is genuinely fun.

So yeah, sometimes it’s good to code without deadlines and a real plan in mind.

You should try it out. You might be surprised by what comes out of it.
