During the internship period, I had the opportunity of trying different technologies and working with different teams, which turned this stage very important for my professional growth. Firstly I worked with web development using technologies such as Javascript, React, Sass and Redux. After that, I started to develop apps with React Native and was responsible for fixing bugs, developing new features, and delivering new test and production releases of the app.
