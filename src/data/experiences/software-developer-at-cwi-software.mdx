In addition to developing new features and fixing bugs in already established Front-end applications, I took part in the entire process of conception, development, and delivery of many applications, developed with ReactJS and ReactNative, that are daily accessed by thousands of users. Furthermore, I participated in the evolution and improvement of important processes for the development of the projects: Implementation of CI/CD, implementation of unit tests, and the rewrite of front-ends with more recent technologies.
Other experiences during this period:

<br />
**- Crescer Assistant Instructor:** Going back to the program that was responsible
for starting my journey as a software developer was extremely gratifying. During
this period I was responsible for helping the students, correcting their project's
code, and giving them feedback about their evolution.

<br />
**- React Native Bootcamp Instructor:** I had the opportunity to work as an instructor
for the Bootcamp given to dozens of employees within the company. I was able to help
them reach a better understanding of the React Native and mobile app development
ecosystem. In addition, I was responsible, along with my teammates, for organizing
and delivering all the training material.
