As a Full-stack Software Engineer on the **Distribution Squad**, I focus on delivering **end-to-end solutions**, with a strong focus on **product outcomes**. Some of my key achievements include:
            
- Delivered the Booking.com **bookings reconciliation flow**, enabling users to update booking information directly within the Cloudbeds platform, reducing **external dependencies**;
- Developed a **database migration rollback test pipeline**, preventing schema-breaking errors and ensuring smooth rollbacks during deployments;
- Built a **modular settings system** enabling properties to customize operational preferences, improving **feature adoption** and reducing **configuration-related support issues**;
- Fixed a complex, long-standing **out-of-memory error** in the booking ingestion flow, eliminating **dozens of daily DLQ alerts** and improving reliability for customers.
