As a Full-stack Software Engineer on the **Distribution Squad**, I focus on delivering **end-to-end solutions**, with a strong focus on **product outcomes**. Some of my key achievements include:
            
- Delivered the Booking.com **bookings reconciliation flow**, enabling users to update booking information directly within the Cloudbeds platform;
- Developed a **test pipeline** to ensure that our **database migration rollbacks** were being properly applied and that they didn't break the database schema;
- Built a **modular settings system** enabling properties to customize operational preferences, improving **feature adoption** and reducing **configuration-related support issues**.
