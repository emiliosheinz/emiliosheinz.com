As a Senior Frontend Software Engineer at Cloudbeds, I have contributed to streamlining development workflows, modernizing legacy systems, and implementing solutions that enhance both internal processes and customer experience. My key achievements are:

- Integrated with distribution channels like Tripadvisor, Hopper, and HRS, while also enhancing existing connections with platforms such as Booking.com, Vrbo, and Airbnb.
- Created a formal process for building new Microfrontends, reducing code duplication, and improving organizational scalability.
- Optimized the Frontend local development environment by reducing our Docker image size by 87%, implementing a custom multi-platform image and an automated CI/CD workflow.
- Developed a Chrome extension to streamline feature flag management, reducing the time it takes to enable or disable a feature flag from minutes to seconds.
- Implemented the company's first AI Assistant, achieving an 18% deflection rate, 84% engagement rate, and a 10% reduction in support tickets, with a CSAT score of 4.2.
- Led the Easy Onboarding project, cutting small property onboarding time from weeks to days. Developed Playwright E2E tests to cover critical flows, implemented Lambda functions for image uploads to S3 and Salesforce API authentication, and created workflows with GitHub Actions for testing, linting, building, and deploying across multiple environments.
- Migrated legacy features from Vue, Handlebars, and jQuery to modern technologies like React, Chakra UI, and TanStack React Query, ensuring adherence to best coding practices and maintaining robust unit test coverage.
- Created a shared Prettier configuration adopted by dozens of projects, improving code consistency and reducing review bottlenecks.
