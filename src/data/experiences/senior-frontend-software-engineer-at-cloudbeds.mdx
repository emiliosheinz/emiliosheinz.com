In the **Distribution Squad**, I ensure seamless booking ingestion, reconciliation, and new channel integrations. I tackle the challenge of scaling solutions across **300+** online travel agencies, wholesalers, global distribution systems, and regional channels, supporting **partnerships** and new **revenue streams**. My key achievements are:

- Optimized the frontend local development environment by reducing our Docker image size by **87%**, implementing a custom multi-platform image and an automated **CI/CD workflow**;
- Developed a **Chrome extension** to streamline **feature flag** management, reducing the time to toggle a local feature flag from **minutes to seconds**;
- Implemented the company's first **AI Assistant**, achieving an **18%** deflection rate, an **84%** engagement rate, and a **10%** reduction in support tickets, with a CSAT score of **4.2**;
- Led the **Easy Onboarding** project, cutting property onboarding time from **weeks to days**. Developed **Playwright E2E tests** to cover critical flows, implemented **Lambda functions** for image uploads to **S3** and **Salesforce API authentication**, and created **workflows with GitHub Actions** for **testing**, **linting**, **building**, and **deploying** across multiple environments;
- Migrated legacy features from **Vue, Handlebars, and jQuery** to a more modern architecture based on **Micro-frontends, React, Chakra UI, and TanStack React Query**, ensuring adherence to best coding practices and maintaining robust **unit test coverage**;
- Created a **shared Prettier configuration** adopted by dozens of projects, improving **code consistency** and reducing **review bottlenecks**.
