During this period, in addition to my leadership role, I also worked as a Frontend Software Engineer. Juggling both roles provided a great opportunity to enhance my time management skills and develop my ability to handle diverse individuals and situations. Some of my key achievements include:

- Served as a technical reference, leading and supporting teams with over 30 engineers
- Led the migration of the Frontend of 8 e-commerces to React, Next.js and TypeScript
- Promoted the company's culture by delivering tech talks about several technologies and best practices
- Improved the performance of several Frontend applications by using caching and lazy loading strategies
