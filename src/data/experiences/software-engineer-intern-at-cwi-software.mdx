During my internship period, I gained **hands-on experience** working with different technologies and teams, which played a crucial role in my **professional growth**. Initially, I worked on web development using **JavaScript, React, Sass, and Redux**. Later, I transitioned to **React Native**, where I fixed bugs, developed features, and delivered stable releases to production.
